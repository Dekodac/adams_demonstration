# Tips & Advice for working in teams with git

## Two people should never touch the same file at the same time

If two different people are doing work in the same file, they should communicate and coordinate in advance. They should decide who will do their work first, and the second person should wait until the first is done.

Otherwise the risk of a merge conflict or getting code into a "bad state" is *very high.*

This scenario is a blocker and should be proactively spotted early and planned around.
