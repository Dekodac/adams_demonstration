# Git Workshop

## Prerequesites

Students should already have experience using git and github (solo, not in teams) for their assignments and assessments. This workshop assumes some basic knowledge and experience with Git

## Objectives

You will learn git workflows and techniques for common "scenarios" that can be tricky. We will do some branching, but not yet focus on things like merge conflicts, etc. You will do solo work in a repo to "simulate" some aspects of doing work collaboratively.

These skills will be helpful for Part Two of the workshop, where you will do work in teams and be making "feature branches", pull requests, and merging feature branches onto shared dev/main/prod branches.

## Topics Covered

1. ["I committed code I don't want" - using `git reset` to safely un-stage or un-commit code](./git-reset.md)
